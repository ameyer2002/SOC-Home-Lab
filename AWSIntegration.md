# Connecting CloudTrail and an EC2 Instance

Because I want this SOC to be hybrid, I will be connecting AWS to it, specifically using CloudTrail and an EC2 Instance. Down the line, I will likely setup more services to understand how they work in conjuction with a SOC.

The first thing I am going to do is create a trail in CloudTrail.
