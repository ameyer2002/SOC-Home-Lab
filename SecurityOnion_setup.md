# Security Onion

I did some research and found this [Github repo](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/2.4/main/DOWNLOAD_AND_VERIFY_ISO.md) that had the ISO image to download. On Security Onion's documentation, I saw I could download an AMI for Security Onion to be deployed in AWS which is really intriguing and something I may pursue down the line when I want to switch up the architecture of this SOC. But to start, I will have to configure two interfaces for this. One for management and one for sniffing. The management interface will be assigned an IP of **192.168.19.90**. I ran into an issue that took me quite a few hours to troubleshoot. I enabled the DHCP setting to assign the gateway IP address and DNS server address to my virtual network adapter using NAT in the virtual network editor of the hypervisor which made me think those addresses would be assigned at the time of installation. However, at the end of the installation, I was receiving a message that said "Could not resolve hostname: sigs.securityonion.net". I knew this was a DNS resolving issue but I could not figure out how to pinpoint where this issue was stemming from. I tried using different network adapters with bridged mode, deleting and downloading the ISO image numerous amount of times, etc,. Well, turned out that the DHCP server was never assigning a DNS server or default gateway address to the virtual network adapter I was using. I ran ipconfig /all on my host machine to identify all of the network connections on my machine and saw the default gateway and DNS server were blank. I finally set the default gateway to **192.168.19.2** and the DNS server to 8.8.8.8 and a backup of **8.8.4.4.**. This allowed for the DNS to be resolved and fixed the issue.
